h1. Scaffold for Python

Inspired by "Zed Shaw's":http://www.zedshaw.com/ recommended Python project structure from "Learn Python the Hard Way":http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ exercise "#46":http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex46.html.

Each project you scaffold will create the following directory structure:

<pre>
/[projectname]/
/[projectname]/setup.py
/[projectname]/bin
/[projectname]/docs
/[projectname]/[projectname]
/[projectname]/[projectname]/__init__.py
/[projectname]/tests
/[projectname]/tests/__init__.py
/[projectname]/tests/[projectname]_tests.py
</pre>

Both @setup.py@ and @[projectname]_tests.py@ are set up automatically to reference your project name as a module. The rest is up to you!

h2. Installing Scaffold

You can view the scaffold package on PyPi here: "http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Scaffold/0.1.3":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Scaffold/0.1.3

To install, simply use @pip install scaffold@

h2. Running Scaffold

Scaffold installs itself as an executable Python script, so just enter the @pyscaffold@ command on your favorite terminal:

<pre>pyscaffold -p "projectname" [-d {base directory}]</pre>

You can also run scaffold as a python module if needed:

<pre>python -m scaffold -p "projectname" [-d {base directory}]</pre>

The @-p@ parameter is the name of your project and is a required field. If you don't specify a base directory with the @-d@ parameter, scaffold will assume that you want to create your project skeleton in your current working directory.

h3. Sample Usage:

Just to give you an idea of what works and what doesn't...

<pre>pyscaffold -p "http-utils" -d /c/repositories/
pyscaffold -p "mutliplex-py"
pyscaffold -p "lazarus" -d ../</pre>

h2. Virtualenvwrapper support

Alternatively, if (the excellent) "virtualenvwrapper":http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org is installed, Scaffold also works as a "project template":https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/projects.html#using-templates named _base_. So you could run:

<pre>mkproject -t base projectname</pre>

Then virtualenvwrapper will create the virtualenv and the project root and Scaffold will do the rest.

I'm not the most experienced Python programmer on the planet, so patches are most certainly welcome :)

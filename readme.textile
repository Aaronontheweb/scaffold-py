h1. Scaffold for Python

Inspired by "Zed Shaw":http://www.zedshaw.com/'s recommended Python project structure from "Learn Python the Hard Way":http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ exercise "#46":http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex46.html.

Each project you scaffold will create the following directory structure:

<pre>
/[projectname]/
/[projectname]/setup.py
/[projectname]/bin
/[projectname]/docs
/[projectname]/[projectname]
/[projectname]/[projectname]/__init__.py
/[projectname]/tests
/[projectname]/tests/__init__.py
/[projectname]/tests/[projectname]_tests.py
</pre>

Both @setup.py@ and @[projectname]_tests.py@ are set up automatically to reference your project name as a module. The rest is up to you!

h2. Running Scaffold

Scaffold installs itself as an executeable Python script, so just enter this on your command line:

<pre>python -m scaffold -p "projectname" [-d {base directory to create the project from}]</pre>

If you don't specify a @-d@ flag, scaffold will assume that you want to create your project skeleton in your current working directory.

I'm not the most experienced Python programmer on the planet, so patches are most certainly welcome :)
